    <h2>Michigan Weather</h2>

    <p>As you may have figured out, Michigan winter weather is notoriously bad. There’s slush(link), snow, ice…. The good news is that with the right gear, you can get survive and even thrive in Michigan winters.
    </p>

    <p>If you’re completely new to cold weather, especially snow, keep reading.
    </p>

    <p>The first thing you should get is a good winter coat. Your coat should be: Warm. Look for a coat with down in it. These features will keep you warm. Here’s a nice guide to down fill and fill weight. (link https://triplefatgoose.com/blogs/down-time/a-guide-to-down-jacket-warmth-down-fill-power-vs-down-weight).
      TL/DR; look for a coat with 550+ down fill, but make sure it’s not a super light coat. Waterproof. The coat should be “waterPROOF”, not just “water resistant”. The tags will indicate that whether it is either. What’s the difference? “Water resistant”
      means you’ll still get soaked in a rain storm or snow storm. “Waterproof” means you will be completely dry. If you want to be extra-sure that your coat is waterproof, look for a coat with a DWR coating (link to https://www.backcountry.com/explore/dwr-decoded).
      Windproof. It’s not enough to get a warm, waterproof coat if it doesn’t block the wind. I find that waterproof coats usually block the wind well, however. To test a coat, just examine the coat’s outermost layer. Does it seem like it would block
      the wind? If it’s just a thin, polyester layer, keep looking.
    </p>

    <p>Your second investment is a good pair of boots. Your boots should be: Waterproof. Unless you work from home from November to March, you will encounter snow- and its ugly cousin, slush (link) - when you go outside. To arrive at work or school with
      dry feet, invest in waterproof boots. Now this can be tricky. Some boots are, again, “water-resistant”, which in practice means very little. You’ll want to either buy specifically “waterproof” boots, or spray your normal, non-waterproof pair with
      waterproofing spray. I used this (linkhttps://www.thewalkingcompany.com/abeo-eco-rain-&-stain-none/m0138-2001) one on my suede boots, making sure to hit the seams, and it worked well. I re-spray the boots every few weeks in the winter months. Warm.
      You’ll want a decent amount of insulation when it’s -15 degrees Farenheit outside (rare, but it happens). For this reason, I recommend buying boots with a bit of insulation - in order words, more than just rainboots. However, if you do buy rainboots,
      you can still make them warm and cozy with a pair of thick wool socks.
    </p>

    <p>You’ll also want a hat, or something to cover your ears. Beanies work well, as do insulated headbands and earmuffs. Try a few styles to see what you like.
    </p>

    <p>Don’t forget about gloves! You can snag a cheap pair anywhere for cold days, but for the coldest days, consider ski gloves (link https://www.rei.com/c/ski-gloves?r=c&origin=web&ir=category%3Aski-gloves&page=1). They’re not very fashionable, but they
      keep your hands warm and dry. For medium-cold days, try leather gloves. If they’re leather with a layer of cashmere inside, they’ll keep your hands plenty warm for most milder winter days.
    </p>

    <p>A scarf is your number-one line of defense for your face and neck. Wool scarves are the warmest, but wool blends work well, as do thick fabrics of any kind.
