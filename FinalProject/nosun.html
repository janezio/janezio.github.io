    <h2>Where’s the Sun?</h2>

    <p>Depending on when you moved to Michigan, you may have noticed this already: Michigan has very little sun in the wintertime.
    </p>

    <p>Here’s how I cope:
    </p>

    <p>Vitamin D supplements. Your skin usually makes Vitamin D from the sun, so you should supplement during the winter. Ask your doctor about the amount you should take. Sun lamp. Lamps emitting at least 10,000 lux, or units of light, can mimic the sun’s
      light. Scientists aren’t sure whether this light produces more serotonin(link https://verilux.com/sad-light-therapy-seasonal-affective-disorder) in the brain, or whether it simply helps regulate circadian rhythm (link https://verilux.com/blog/light-therapy-for-circadian-rhythm-disorder),
      but I can tell you that light therapy light works for me and many others.
