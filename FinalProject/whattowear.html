    <h2>What to Wear</h2>

    <h3>As you may have figured out, Michigan winter weather is notoriously bad. There’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=slush+snow&sa=X&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS760US760&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&ved=0ahUKEwjP4rG615_aAhWLq1kKHUCuD08Q7AkIQw&biw=1118&bih=534">slush</a>, snow, ice…. The good news is that with the right gear, you can get survive and even thrive in Michigan winters.
    </h3>

    <p>If you’re completely new to cold weather, especially snow, keep reading.
    </p>

    <p>The first thing you should get is a good winter coat. Your coat should be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Warm. Look for a coat with down in it. These features will keep you warm. Here’s <a target="_blank" href="https://triplefatgoose.com/blogs/down-time/a-guide-to-down-jacket-warmth-down-fill-power-vs-down-weight">a nice guide to down fill and fill weight</a>.
        The short version: look for a coat with 550+ down fill, but make sure it’s not a super light coat.
      </li>
      <li>Waterproof. The coat should be “water<em>proof</em>”, not just “water resistant”. The tags will indicate that whether it is either. What’s the difference? “Water resistant” means you’ll still get soaked in a rain storm or snow storm. “Waterproof”
        means you will be completely dry. If you want to be extra-sure that your coat is waterproof, look for a coat with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.backcountry.com/explore/dwr-decodet">DWR coating</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Windproof. It’s not enough to get a warm, waterproof coat if it doesn’t block the wind. I find that waterproof coats usually block the wind well, however. To test a coat, just examine the coat’s outermost layer. Does it seem like it would block
        the wind? If it’s just a thin, polyester layer, keep looking.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your second investment is a good pair of boots. Your boots should be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waterproof. Unless you work from home from November to March, you will encounter snow- and its ugly cousin, slush (link) - when you go outside. To arrive at work or school with dry feet, invest in waterproof boots. Now this can be tricky. Some boots
        are, again, “water-resistant”, which in practice means very little. You’ll want to either buy specifically “waterproof” boots, or spray your normal, non-waterproof pair with waterproofing spray. I used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thewalkingcompany.com/abeo-eco-rain-&-stain-none/m0138-2001">this one</a>        on my suede boots, making sure to hit the seams, and it worked well. I re-spray the boots every few weeks in the winter months.
      </li>
      <li>Warm. You’ll want a decent amount of insulation when it’s -15 degrees Farenheit outside (rare, but it happens). For this reason, I recommend buying boots with a bit of insulation - in other words, more than just rainboots. However, if you do buy
        rainboots, you can still make them warm and cozy with a pair of thick wool socks.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You’ll also want a hat, or something to cover your ears. Beanies work well, as do insulated headbands and earmuffs. Try a few styles to see what you like.
    </p>

    <p>Don’t forget about gloves! You can snag a cheap pair anywhere for cold days, but for the coldest days, consider <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rei.com/c/ski-gloves?r=c&origin=web&ir=category%3Aski-gloves&page=1">ski gloves</a>. They’re not very
      fashionable, but they keep your hands warm and dry. For medium-cold days, try leather gloves. If they’re leather with a layer of cashmere inside, they’ll keep your hands plenty warm for most milder winter days.
    </p>

    <p>A scarf is your number-one line of defense for your face and neck. Wool scarves are the warmest, but wool blends work well, as do thick fabrics of any kind.
