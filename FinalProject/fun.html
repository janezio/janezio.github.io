    <br><h2>Fun Things To Do</h2>

    <h3>For those of us who like to go outside as often as possible in the summer, winter can mean prolonged periods of time spent indoors. Here’s a list of my all-time favorite physical activities that you can do indoors and out.
    </h3>

    <p>Number one, of course, is skiing at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mtbrighton.com/">Mount Brighton</a>. Not only is it scenic, you can also learn how to ski there - and I know it can be frightening for beginners! You don’t even have to own a pair of skis to go - you can rent skis and all accompanying
      equipment on-site.
    </p>

    <p>Secondly, dancing, dancing, dancing. But this is the Midwest, you say. People don’t dance here, you say. Well, that’s just not true…. I dance! Not well. But I do. Anyway. I really recommend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/swingannarbor/?ref=br_rs">Swing Ann Arbor</a>
      because they have a lesson before every dance. It’s a low-key environment and the instructors are friendly and upbeat. They also play a range of music, which I appreciate.
    </p>

    <p>Third, treat yourself to a show at <a target="_blank" href="http://theark.org/">the Ark</a>, a well-know music venue. I took advantage of Take A Chance Tuesday, which is always free, to see my friend <a target="_blank" href="https://lizzyshell.bandcamp.com">Lizzy Shell</a>. Even though I sat closer to the back than the
      front, I could hear her voice crystal-clearly. The Ark often hosts bigger names, too, like Joan Baez and Mary Chapin Carpenter.
    </p>

    <p>Lastly, there’s always <a target="_blank" href="https://mbgna.umich.edu/nichols-arboretum/">the Arb</a>. Also known as Nichols Arboretum, the Arb is perhaps Ann Arbor’s most-loved park. It’s got everything: the Huron River, a prairie, and a wide meadow surrounded by hills. It’s easily accessible from Central Campus, though
      be advised that parking is a nightmare.
